## Reporting a Vulnerability

You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <security@o11y.top> or reported via [Security Advisory](https://github.com/o11y-top/aws-terraform-multiple-environments/security/advisories/new).
